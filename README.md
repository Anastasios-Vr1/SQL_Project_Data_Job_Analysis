# Introduction
üìäEmbark on a journey into the dynamic data job market! Centered around data analyst roles, this project delves into üí∞ top-paying jobs, üî• in-demand skills, and the intersection where high demand üìà aligns with generous salaries in the realm of data analytics.

üîç SQL queries? Check them out here: [project_sql folder](/project_sql/)

### The questions I aimed to address through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.
- **Excel:** Useful for data analysis, data cleaning, removing duplicates, table creation and generation of basic & informative charts and graphs.

# The Data

The dataset used for this project was sourced during 2023 from job postings collected daily from Google‚Äôs search results, totaling approximately 6,500 jobs per day. These postings primarily focused on data science-type roles from around the globe. The inception and creation of the accompanying app stemmed from Luke Barrouse. In the [live app](https://datanerd.tech/About), the job postings were sent through an NLP pipeline and then aggregated daily to identify top skills and median salaries. [Luke Barrouse](https://datanerd.tech/About) was the mastermind behind this very useful tool for Data Science Nerds. For a sample of the data, you can [check out Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lukebarousse/data-analyst-job-postings-google-search)

### The ERD
The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) helps us visualize the structure and relationships between the differet tables in this database. You can see below that we have 4 major tables of which "job_postings_fact" is a fact table and the other 3 "skills_job_dim", "skills_dim", "company_dim" are dimentional tables that will help in filtering and grouping data down the road.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:

## 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim
    ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
````
Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:
- **Wide Salary Range:** Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $184,000 to $650,000, indicating significant salary potential in the field.

## 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.
```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM 
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim
        ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY 
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills AS skill_name,
    COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY skills ) AS skill_count
FROM 
    top_paying_jobs
JOIN skills_job_dim
    ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
JOIN skills_dim 
    ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC;
```
Here's the breakdown of the most demanded skills for data analysts in 2023, based on job postings:
